This directory contains a subset of the configuration managed by cfengine
on Errata Tool environments.

This may be used to log and review cfengine changes.
For example, if working on a bug which involves cfengine changes:

- Modify cfengine files in this directory
- Push to gerrit, set bug to POST
- After approved, merge it, set bug to MODIFIED
- Before the bug moves to ON_QA, ask eng-ops to deploy changes to devel
  and qe environments
- Let QE test it
- After bug moves to VERIFIED, ask eng-ops to deploy changes to staging
  and production environments

Note this assumes it's OK to perform the cfengine changes earlier than the
next Errata Tool release.

WARNING: this is not the authoritative source for the cfengine configuration.
The files in this directory might be outdated.
