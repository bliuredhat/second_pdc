An automated nochannel push has failed.

<%= render 'push_job', :job => @job -%>

This push job was triggered automatically by Errata Tool due to a staging
push. This failure doesn't block the advisory, but may result in a slow
live push.

This ticket has been filed for the investigation of this problem.
