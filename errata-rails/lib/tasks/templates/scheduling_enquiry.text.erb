[errata] Update stage and production Errata Tool to version <%= short_name %>

h2. Summary

We're aiming to release Errata Tool <%= full_name %> to production later this week, (or early next week depending on final QE). Please let us know if this timing is not convenient.

We'll provide the details about the final RPM when it's ready via this task as per usual.

<% if teiid_update_required %>
NB: There is a Teiid DDL schema change required, so we will need to coordinate the update with an update to Teiid. Further details will be provided.
<% end %>

Regards,

[Errata Tool Team|https://docs.engineering.redhat.com/x/0IcEAQ].
