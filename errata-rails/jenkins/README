Jenkins Scripts
===============

This directory contains scripts intended for usage in Jenkins.
Generally, a Jenkins job should do nothing more than execute one script
in this directory.

It's also possible to use the scripts locally, but note the following:

* The scripts expect to be able to write to the workspace (errata-rails
  checkout).  For example, they'll write test report files or RPMs
  into the top-level errata-rails directory.

* The scripts use some docker containers which execute as uid=1000.  If
  this is not your uid then you may have to take some action to let the
  containers write to the workspace, e.g.

    setfacl -m u:1000:rwX -R .

* It might be necessary to disable SELinux.
