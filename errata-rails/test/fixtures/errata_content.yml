    The Red Hat Global File System (GFS) provides high availability of critical
    server applications in the event of planned or unplanned system downtime.
    
    These updated GFS packages are in sync with the latest kernel
    (2.4.21-31.EL). The modules in earlier GFS packages fail to load because
    they do not match the running kernel. It is possible to force load the
    modules; however, this update alleviates the need to do so.
    
    In addition, the following bugs have been discovered and addressed since
    the previous release:
    
    - Fixed a node panic doing a writev
    - lock_gulm.o now has the ability to modify its verbosity level
    - Pool tools read the /dev/ directory structure when emcpower devices are
    detected in /proc/partitions
    - Fixed a race condition in the ccsd startup process which causes ccsd to
    hang when the 'lo' device has not been configured
    - Added sanbox2 fencing agent
    - Clarified fence_brocade help
    - Init scripts for gnbd have been added
    - Added an optional key, "usedev" to a node in the nodes.ccs which will
    force gulm to use the IP address from the device specified
    - An updated fsck command was added that greatly reduces the fsck times for
    GFS filesystems
    
    Users are advised to upgrade to these latest GFS packages, which are
    updated for use with the 2.4.21-31.EL kernel.

    How to Test:
    ---------------------------------------
    149407 - Install the nfs-utils package and make sure the
             /var/log/lastlog is NOT updated.
    
    164186 - 1) On server added the folowing to file  /etc/exports :
                  /tmp *(ro)
             2) On server restart nfs :
                 # service nfs restart
    
             3) On client mount/unmount  (WORKS) :
                 # mount server123.redhat.com:/tmp /mnt/tmp
                 # umount /tmp/mnt
    
             4) On server re-export /tmp :
                 # exportfs -rv
                   exporting *:/tmp
                   unexporting client123.redhat.com:/tmp from kernel
    
    153094 - Create a file that is larger than 2G and try NFS mounting it. The
             mount should be successful.
    
    152980 - 1) Create a list of filesystems to export and export them
                using ONE exportfs process
             2) Have client mount all exported filesystem.
             3) Unexport all the filesystems using ONE exportfs process.
             4) Re-export all the filesystem using more that process.
                (Use -v flag to ensure each process does do an export)
             5) Make sure all the filesystem were re-exported correctly but
                accessing them  from the client (i.e. do an ls on all the mounted
                filesystems)
    
    140385 - I was never able to reproduce this error, so I totally dependent on 
             one of our customers. I guess the best way to test this is to 
             ensure there are no regressions.

  description: |-
    The JBoss Application Server is a powerful J2EE application server.
    
    A flaw was found in the JMX Console fine-grained Access Control feature.
    An administrator with 'Read Mode' privileges to the JMX service could
    gain additional privileges if another administrator who had 'Write Mode'
    privileges was logged into and accessed the console at the same time.
    (CVE-2007-1354)
    
    Note: Fine-grained Access Control was first added to JBoss Application
    Server in June 2006; earlier versions are not affected by this issue.
    
    Known vulnerable versions include: JBoss AS 4.0.2.GA_CP02, 4.0.2.GA_CP03,
    4.0.2.GA_CP04, 4.0.5.GA, 4.0.5_CP01, and 4.0.5_CP02.
    
    This vulnerability is rectified and does not affect JBoss AS releases
    5.0.0.Beta2, 4.2.0.GA, 4.0.5.SP1, 3.2.8.SP2, and cumulative patches
    4.0.5.GA_CP03, 4.0.2.GA_CP05, 4.0.4.GA_CP06, 4.0.3.SP1_CP05, and
    3.2.8.SP1_CP01.
    
    Users with an affected installation of JBoss Application Server who rely on
    granting read-only privileges to the console should upgrade to one of these
    updated versions.

    These updated nautilus packages provide fixes for a bug which occurred when
    excess redraws caused a delay between right-clicking on the desktop and the
    contextual menu appearing. This was especially evident on large displays,
    such as monitors with diagonal viewable image lengths of 760mm (30"). In
    this updated package, excess redraws have been removed, which resolves this
    issue.
    
    This original errata fixed a bug where umask values were not honored when
    files were created through Nautilus. New, empty files were created with a
    permission mode of 600. In these updated packages, the umask setting is
    honored when creating new files with Nautilus.

    Red Hat Enterprise IPA is an integrated solution to provide
    centrally-managed Identity (machines, users, virtual machines, groups,
    authentication credentials), Policy (configuration settings, access control
    information) and Audit (events, logs, analysis) services.
    
    A flaw was found in the Red Hat Enterprise IPA installation procedure. The
    master Kerberos password was set up in the LDAP server in such a way that
    it was possible to retrieve the password via an anonymous LDAP connection.
    (CVE-2008-3274)
    
    Note: the master Kerberos password is used to encrypt keys. This flaw does
    not lead to individual keys being exposed.
    
    Users of Red Hat IPA should upgrade to these updated packages and perform
    the operations explained in the solution to resolve this issue.
  doc_review_due_at:

  how_to_test: |+
    1. Install a previous IPA version (at least 2 servers to test both master and
    replicas fixes).
    
    2. Create an arbitrary number of user accounts and service principals, and
    assign passwords/retrieve keytabs
    
    3. Verify that the following ldap query returns the krbMkey attribute
    anonymously, this is the bug.
    
      ldapsearch -x -b cn=kerberos,<your suffix> '(krbmkey=*)'
    
    4. upgrade all servers and *restart* dirsrv (no other daemon need to be
    restarted at this stage
    
    5. On one master run the tool:
    
      ipa-fix-2008-3274 --check
    
     It should report that the system is vulnerable.
    
    6. Now run:
    
      ipa-fix-2008-3274 --fix
    
     It should dump all kerberos principals, reload them and return that the
    operation completed successfully. It should also create a gpg file encrypted
    symmetrically with the directory manager password. It contains a backup of all
    kerberos material.
    
    7. On all the other ipa masters run:
    
      ipa-fix-2008-3274 --fix-replica
    
     It should say that the system is *not* vulnerable and restart the KDC
    
    8. Test randomly on all masters that users can kinit properly with their old
    password and services can use their current keytabs without issues.

    To fully resolve this problem, you need to manually perform the following
    steps after installing the updated packages:
    
    Disclaimer: The following procedure performs critical, low-level operations
    on your IPA system, and it is imperative that you back up your system
    before carrying out any of the following steps. A failure during this
    procedure may compromise the readability of all or part of your Kerberos
    keys.
    
    1. Upgrade all of your servers (masters and replicas) and restart the
    dirsrv service on all of them. No other daemon needs to be restarted at
    this stage.
    
    2. On one master server, run the following tool:
        $ ipa-fix-2008-3274 --check
    
    This should report that the system is vulnerable.
    
    3. On the same master server, run the following tool:
        $ ipa-fix-2008-3274 --fix
    
    This should dump all Kerberos principals, reload them, and then return a 
    message stating that the operation completed successfully. If not, you
    should contact Red Hat GSS for immediate assistance.
    
    This step should also create a .gpg file symmetrically-encrypted with the 
    Directory Manager password. This file contains a backup of all Kerberos 
    key material and is written to /var/lib/ipa/.
    
    Attention: DO NOT RUN THIS COMMAND ON ANY OTHER SERVER. See the next step.
    
    4. On all other IPA servers, run the following tool:
        $ ipa-fix-2008-3274 --fix-replica
    
    This will report that the system is NOT vulnerable and will then download
    the master key for the local KDC instance. This command will restart the
    KDC service.

    * an unnecessary XML tag was added to a block of text in Chapter 7,
    "Configuring Disk Quotas". These tags caused the example "/etc/fstab" file
    included at the beginning of this chapter to display as a single line. This

    To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:
    
    rpm -Fvh [filenames]
    
    where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
    RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
    not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
    can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
    desired RPMs.
    
    Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
    people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
    launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

    Nagios is a program that can monitor hosts and services on your network. It

    A shell command injection flaw was discovered in the statuswml.cgi CGI

    could use this flaw to run arbitrary commands with the privileges of the
    web server user (apache). (CVE-2009-2288)
    
    Note: Successful authentication is required to access Nagios web pages. In
    the Red Hat HPC Solution, configuration for Nagios is provided by the
    kusu-nagios-config package, which creates a user with a fixed, default

    The Apache HTTP Server is a popular Web server.
    
    A denial of service flaw was found in the Apache mod_proxy module when it
    was used as a reverse proxy. A remote attacker could use this flaw to force
    a proxy process to consume large amounts of CPU time. (CVE-2009-1890)
    
    A denial of service flaw was found in the Apache mod_deflate module. This
    module continued to compress large files until compression was complete,
    even if the network connection that requested the content was closed before
    compression completed. This would cause mod_deflate to consume large
    amounts of CPU if mod_deflate was enabled for a large file. (CVE-2009-1891)
    
    A flaw was found in the handling of the "Options" and "AllowOverride"
    directives used by the Apache HTTP Server. In configurations using the
    "AllowOverride" directive with certain "Options=" arguments, local users
    were not restricted from executing commands from a Server-Side-Include

    Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to support
    the cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server
    applications. Applications built with NSS can support SSLv2, SSLv3, TLS,
    and other security standards. Red Hat Certificate System 7.3 uses NSS to
    support these features.
    
    A flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure
    Sockets Layer) protocols handled session renegotiation. A man-in-the-middle
    attacker could use this flaw to prefix arbitrary plain text to a client's
    session (for example, an HTTPS connection to a website). This could force
    the server to process an attacker's request as if the attacker had
    authenticated using the victim's credentials. This update addresses this
    flaw for server applications using the NSS library by disabling all
    renegotiations by default. (CVE-2009-3555)
    
    Configuration changes are also required for Red Hat Certificate System 7.3
    servers to work correctly with these updated dirsec-nss packages. The

    The rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
    (RHEV) Hypervisor ISO disk image. The RHEV Hypervisor is a dedicated
    Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes everything
    necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the Red Hat
    Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
    Virtualization Agent.
    
    Note: RHEV Hypervisor is only available for the Intel 64 and AMD64
    architectures with virtualization extensions.
    
    A flaw was found in the sctp_rcv_ootb() function in the Linux kernel Stream
    Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation. A remote attacker
    could send a specially-crafted SCTP packet to a target system, resulting in
    a denial of service. (CVE-2010-0008)
    
    A flaw was found in the way the x86 emulator in KVM loaded segment
    selectors (used for memory segmentation and protection) into segment
    registers. In some guest system configurations, an unprivileged guest user
    could leverage this flaw to crash the guest or possibly escalate their
    privileges within the guest. (CVE-2010-0419)
    
    The KVM x86 emulator implementation was missing a check for the Current
    Privilege Level (CPL) while accessing debug registers. An unprivileged user
    in a guest could leverage this flaw to crash the guest. (CVE-2009-3722)
    
    A flaw was found in the USB passthrough handling code in KVM. A
    specially-crafted USB packet sent from inside a guest could be used to
    trigger a buffer overflow in the usb_host_handle_control() function, which
    runs under the QEMU-KVM context on the host. A user in a guest could
    leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service (guest hang or crash) or
    possibly escalate their privileges within the host. (CVE-2010-0297)
    
    This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
    security issues; however, these issues have no security impact for RHEV
    Hypervisor. These fixes are for kernel issues CVE-2009-4308, CVE-2010-0003,
    CVE-2010-0007, CVE-2010-0415, and CVE-2010-0437; and sudo issues
    CVE-2010-0426 and CVE-2010-0427.
    
    This update also fixes the following bugs:
    
    * the required storage device driver was not detected correctly by mkdumprd
    when using multipath devices. When RHEV Hypervisor was installed on a
    multipath device, kdump was unable to mount the logical volume to store the
    kernel core dump; therefore, the core dump would not be recorded. With this
    update, multipath support has been added to the mkdumprd tool, which
    resolves this issue. (BZ#569459)
    
    As RHEV Hypervisor is based on KVM, the bug fixes from KVM updates
    RHSA-2010:0126 and RHBA-2010:0158 have been included in this update:

    This update fixes the following security issues:
    
    * The compat_alloc_user_space() function in the Linux kernel 32/64-bit
    compatibility layer implementation was missing sanity checks. This function
    could be abused in other areas of the Linux kernel if its length argument
    can be controlled from user-space. On 64-bit systems, a local, unprivileged

    Red Hat would like to thank Ben Hawkes for reporting CVE-2010-3081, and
    Tavis Ormandy for reporting CVE-2010-3067.
    
    This update also fixes the following bugs:
    
    * The RHSA-2010:0631 kernel-rt update resolved an issue (CVE-2010-2240)
    where, when an application has a stack overflow, the stack could silently
    overwrite another memory mapped area instead of a segmentation fault
    occurring. This update implements the official upstream fixes for that
    issue. Note: This is not a security regression. The original fix was
    complete. (BZ#624604)
    
    * In certain circumstances, under heavy load, certain network interface
    cards using the bnx2 driver, and configured to use MSI-X, could stop
    processing interrupts and then network connectivity would cease.
    (BZ#622952)
    
    * This update upgrades the tg3 driver to version 3.110. (BZ#640334)

  description: |-
    Red Hat Certificate System is an enterprise software system designed to
    manage enterprise public key infrastructure (PKI) deployments. Simple
    Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) is a PKI communication protocol
    used to automatically enroll certificates for network devices.
    
    The certificate authority allowed unauthenticated users to request the
    one-time PIN in an SCEP request to be decrypted. An attacker able to sniff
    an SCEP request from a network device could request the certificate
    authority to decrypt the request, allowing them to obtain the one-time
    PIN. With this update, the certificate authority only handles decryption
    requests from authenticated registration authorities. (CVE-2010-3868)
    
    The certificate authority allowed the one-time PIN used in SCEP requests
    to be re-used. An attacker possessing a valid SCEP enrollment one-time PIN
    could use it to generate an unlimited number of certificates.
    (CVE-2010-3869)
    
    The certificate authority used the MD5 hash algorithm to sign all SCEP
    protocol responses. As MD5 is not collision resistant, an attacker could
    use this flaw to perform an MD5 chosen-prefix collision attack to generate
    attack-chosen output signed using the certificate authority's key.
    (CVE-2004-2761)
    
    This update also adds the following enhancements:
    
    * Support for the stronger encryption algorithm Triple-DES (DES3), and
    stronger hash algorithms SHA1, SHA256, and SHA512, for use in SCEP
    communication. These algorithms are in addition to the previously supported
    DES and MD5 algorithms.
    
    * New configuration options for the SCEP server can define the default and
    allowed encryption and hash algorithms. These options allow disabling uses
    of the weaker algorithms not required by network devices and prevent
    possible downgrade attacks. These can be configured by adding the following
    options to the certificate authority's CS.cfg configuration file:
    
       ca.scep.encryptionAlgorithm=DES3
       ca.scep.allowedEncryptionAlgorithms=DES3
       ca.scep.hashAlgorithm=SHA1
       ca.scep.allowedHashAlgorithms=SHA1,SHA256,SHA512
    
    * With this update, the certificate authority's SCEP server is disabled by
    default. The SCEP server can be enabled by adding the 'ca.scep.enable=true'
    option to the certificate authority's CS.cfg configuration file.
    
    * A separate key pair can now be configured for use in SCEP communication.
    Previously, the main certificate authority's key pair was used for SCEP
    communication too. A designated SCEP key pair can be referenced by adding
    a new option, ca.scep.nickname=[scep certificate nickname], to the
    certificate authority's CS.cfg configuration file.
    
    * The certificate authority now allows the size of nonces used in SCEP
    requests to be restricted by adding a new option, ca.scep.nonceSizeLimit=
    [number of bytes], to the certificate authority's CS.cfg configuration
    file. The limit is set to 16 bytes in the default CS.cfg configuration
    file.
    
    All users of Red Hat Certificate System 7.3 should upgrade to these updated
    packages, which resolve these issues and add these enhancements.

    On December 31st, 2010, per the life-cycle support policy, the version 4
    series of Satellite and Proxy products exited Production Phase 2 marking
    the end of their support by Red Hat. Please reference the support policy
    here:
    
    https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/satellite/
    
    Though we are committed to the December 31st date for beginning the
    process of decommissioning Satellite and Proxy 4.x support, we recognize
    that our customers have woven these products very deeply into their
    processes and may need some time to migrate.
    
    For migration purposes, please note the following dates:
    - December 31st, 2010 - Satellite and Proxy 4.x ceased to be supported.
      Official support ended. Only Severity 1 issues and migration assistance
      will be addressed. Satellite and Proxy will continue to operate, but all
      customers are encouraged to migrate in a timely manner.
    - April 30th, 2011 - Satellite and Proxy 4.x active status will be
      terminated. Satellite and Proxy version 4.x will enter an inactive
      state. Satellite and Proxy communication to RHN Hosted will cease to
      function (for example, the satellite-sync command will no longer work).
    
    The Satellite Upgrade process starting point is outlined here:
    
    http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Network_Satellite/5.4/html/Installation_Guide/s1-upgrades.html
    
    How to proceed:
    - All Satellite and Proxy 4.x users must plan to migrate to a newer version
      prior to April 30th, 2011.
    - If you have a Technical Account Manager, contact that person immediately
      to discuss migration plans.
    - Otherwise, contact support for assistance:
      https://www.redhat.com/apps/support/
    - Alternatively, Red Hat Consulting can be engaged to assist with a smooth
      migration: http://www.redhat.com/consulting/
      More information on Red Hat Consulting for Satellite can be found here:
    
    http://www.redhat.com/f/pdf/consulting/RHNSatelliteImplementation-Brochure.pdf
    
    It is critical to ensure you have a plan to migrate off of Satellite and
    Proxy 4.x prior to April 30th, 2011.

    The libdfp package is a decimal floating point math library which is available as an alternative to the glibc math functions on Power and s390x architectures.
    
    This updated libdfp package includes fixes for the following bugs:
    
    * The libdfp package has been upgraded to upstream version 6.0.z. (BZ#657321)
    
    * Prior to this update, only the first 6 decimal digits of a number were printed when using the 'printf' command when the precision modifier was not specified. This was caused due to a faulty shift by one digit when formatting the number. With this update, all decimal digits of a number are displayed when using the aforementioned command. (BZ#657462)
    
    * Under some circumstances, libdfp encountered an issue converting some values from string to DFP with the conversion command 'strtod32'. Specifically, libdfp mapped the '0E+100' value as the 'inf' value instead of the zero value. This issue was not seen when using the 'strtod64' and 'strtod128' commands. With this update, the '0E+100' value is properly mapped and converting values using the 'strtod32' command works as expected. (BZ#658915)
    
    All users of libdfp are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which resolves these issues.

    Decimal Floating Point C Library

    * Rebase libdfp to pick up bug fixes and move out of tech preview (BZ#642693)
    * when formatting a decimal floating point number in 'f' format and rounding the mantissa causes the exponent to increase the resulting number string was shifted right by one digit (BZ#625495)

    Red Hat Directory Server is an LDAPv3-compliant directory server. The
    redhat-ds-base package includes the LDAP server and command line utilities
    for server administration.
    
    A flaw was found in the way Red Hat Directory Server handled simple paged
    result searches. If an unauthenticated user were able to send multiple
    simple paged search requests to Directory Server, it could cause the server
    to crash. (CVE-2011-0019)
    
    When multiple Red Hat Directory Server instances were configured on the
    system to run under different unprivileged users, the Directory Server
    setup scripts set insecure permissions on the /var/run/dirsrv/ directory,
    which stores process ID (pid) files. A local user could use this flaw to
    manipulate the pid files in that directory, possibly preventing Directory
    Server instances from starting correctly, or causing the Directory Server
    init script to kill an arbitrary process when shutting down Directory
    Server. (CVE-2011-0022)
    
    It was found that multiple scripts shipped with Red Hat Directory Server
    set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to an insecure value
    containing an empty path. A local user able to trick a user running those
    scripts (usually the root user) to run them while working from an
    attacker-writable directory could use this flaw to escalate their
    privileges via a specially-crafted dynamic library. (CVE-2011-0532)
    
    All Red Hat Directory Server users should upgrade to these updated
    packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
    packages, the dirsrv daemon must be restarted ("service dirsrv restart")
    for the update to take effect.

    This updated xenpv-win package fixes the following bugs:
    
    * Previously, running the "Sleep Stress With I/O" job from the Windows Logo Kit on RHELNET driver caused a Windows 2003 guest to crash. With this update, the RHELNET driver passes the "Sleep Stress With I/O" job from the Windows Logo Kit also on Windows 2003. (BZ#496771)
    
    * Previously, running the "NDISTest 6.5 (MPE)" job from the Windows Logo Kit on RHELNET driver caused the windows guest to crash. With this update, the RHELNET driver passes the "NDISTest 6.5 (MPE)" job from the Windows Logo Kit. (BZ#656776)
    
    * Previously, shutting off a Windows guest through hibernation caused a crash of the guest. With this update, the RHELSCSI driver behaves properly when guests are hibernated. (BZ#679144)
    
    * Previously, uninstalling the driver package on Windows 2008 would cause the guest to crash on every subsequent reboot.  With this update, the guest will work correctly after uninstalling the driver package. (BZ#679669)
    
    * Previously, applications that were submitting a large number of disk I/O requests directly to the drivers could cause them to leak memory in the guest.  In particular, this happened when running the "Disk Stress" job from the Windows Logo kit on Windows 2003 guests.  With this update, the memory leak has been fixed and the drivers pass the "Disk Stress" job on all supported versions of Windows. (BZ#681440)
    
    * Previously, running the "NDISTest 6.0" job from the Windows Logo Kit failed on Windows XP and Windows 2003 guests.  With this update, the RHELNET driver passes the "NDISTest 6.0" job on all supported versions of Windows.  (BZ#681762)
    
    * Previously, the RHELSCSI driver could fail to load on 32-bit Windows Server 2008 guests after ~100 disable/enable cycles.  With this update, the RHELSCSI sustains a much higher number of disable/enable cycles.  (BZ#689748)

  description: |-
    Apache Tomcat is a servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer
    Pages (JSP) technologies.
    
    It was found that web applications could modify the location of the Tomcat
    host's work directory. As web applications deployed on Tomcat have read and
    write access to this directory, a malicious web application could use this
    flaw to trick Tomcat into giving it read and write access to an arbitrary
    directory on the file system. (CVE-2010-3718)
    
    A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the Manager application,
    used for managing web applications on Tomcat. If a remote attacker could
    trick a user who is logged into the Manager application into visiting a
    specially-crafted URL, the attacker could perform Manager application
    tasks with the privileges of the logged in user. (CVE-2010-4172)
    
    A second cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the Manager
    application. A malicious web application could use this flaw to conduct an
    XSS attack, leading to arbitrary web script execution with the privileges
    of victims who are logged into and viewing Manager application web pages.
    (CVE-2011-0013)
    
    In addition, these updated packages fix the following bugs:
    
    * Creating an additional instance via the tomcat initscripts caused the
    additional instance to fail to start up. This was due to the
    inaccessibility to certain environment variables. With this update,
    additional instances work as expected. (BZ#636997)
    
    * The "/usr/share/java" directory was missing a symlink to the
    "/usr/tomcat6/bin/tomcat6-juli.jar" library. Because this library is
    mandatory for certain operations (such as running the Jasper JSP
    precompiler) the "build-jar-repository" command could not be used to
    compose a valid classpath. With this update, the missing symlink has been
    added. (BZ#661244)
    
    * Prior to this update, the tomcat initscript could not start tomcat if the
    "TOMCAT_USER" environment variable was set to a user daemon without access
    to a login shell. For security reasons, a user daemon should not have
    access to a shell available. However, because of this, tomcat did not start
    and aborted with a "This account is currently not available." message.
    Similarly, the tomcat6 package created a system user that had a valid
    access to shell. With this update, the tomcat initscript has been modified
    to use a temporary shell and the tomcat6 package now creates a system user
    with its shell set to "/sbin/nologin". (BZ#678671)
    
    Users of Tomcat should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
    backported patches to correct these issues. Tomcat must be restarted for
    this update to take effect.

    The fuse packages contain ...
    
    It was discovered that fusermount was vulnerable to a race condition between when a user filesystem was mounted and when the mtab was updated.  If a user were able to win the race, an unprivileged user could trick fusermount into unmounting an arbitrary filesystem they should not have access to. (CVE-2010-3879)
    
    FUSE would try to mount a directory without resolving symlinks before updating the mtab.  If fusermount was unable to update mtab, it would unmount the directory without resolving symlinks, resulting in a different directory being unmounted. (CVE-2011-0541)
    
    Another race condition in fusermount could allow a local user to change the location of the current directory from under FUSE. (CVE-2011-0542)
    
    FUSE attempts to use the '--no-canonicalize' mount option in order to prevent a symlink attack on the mount point written to mtab.  If fusermount was unable to use this mount option, it would fall back to using an insecure mount command instead.  A local user could trigger this by having the entry already exist in mtab. (CVE-2011-0543)
    
    On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, the fusermount tool cannot be used by local users unless they are part of the 'fuse' system group.
    
    Please note: the provided util-linux package provides new mount options, '--no-canonicalize' and '--fake', that are required for these FUSE packages.

    557758: no reliable reproducer, run the loop in comment #0 for few minutes/hours/nights?
    
    562376: no reproducer, please check IP statistics still work as expected (ipSystemStatsTable and ipIfStatsTable)
    
    600319: this one is very very tricky, the description is IMHO clear enough (but check all the comments). Check that bug #521175 is still fixed. There is a  RHTS tests for this  bug, but it tests only part of it!!! 
    
    630905: no reproducer, you can try to spawn lot of processes and let them exit while walking through prTable (you have to configure it first, see man snmpd.conf) and then you get wrong prErrorFlag if you are extremely lucky.
    683142: no reproducer, similar to #630905, but watch hrSWRunTable instead
    
    654384: There is a new snmpd.conf option 'realStorageUnits'. It's 'on' by default (=it behaves as RHEL 5.6 and earlier). Please check it works as it is described in man snmpd.conf. You need a filesystem with small (4096 B) blocks and large size (>16TB) and I am not sure we support any on RHEL5 (ext3 will use large block sizes). I reproduced it using jfs and some device mapper magic on Fedora (I don't have *real* 16TB drive, I used a fake one). xfs could be also usable, but again, probably Fedora only... Or use CentOS kernel with jfs :) Or large NFS mount? But please test this bug carefuly, it's new feature, even in upstream! 
    
    664523: bug report is clear enough and can be easily scripted with device mapper fake devices
    
    These bugs can be probably easily scripted, I might add them to RHTS if I have some time:
    659354, 664523, 676669, 676955
    Others can be scripted too, I am just too lazy to write tests for updated man pages etc. And do not hesitate to write the tests before I do them :).
    
    And as always, please carefuly review my RHTS tests! They might miss some corner cases or I may understand a bug ina wrong way... Feel free to extend them, if you find interesting extension.

  description: |-
    Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
    language.
    
    A buffer over-read flaw was found in the way the Python Expat parser
    handled malformed UTF-8 sequences when processing XML files. A
    specially-crafted XML file could cause Python applications using the Python
    Expat parser to crash while parsing the file. (CVE-2009-3720)
    
    This update makes Python use the system Expat library rather than its own
    internal copy; therefore, users must have the version of Expat shipped with
    RHSA-2009:1625 installed, or a later version, to resolve the CVE-2009-3720
    issue.
    
    A flaw was found in the way the handlers for ftp: and file: URLs in the
    Python urllib and urllib2 libraries processed the urllib open URL request.
    If a server were running a Python web application that processed URLs, a
    remote attacker could use a specially-crafted urllib request to obtain
    sensitive information about that server, or cause the web application to
    consume excessive CPU and memory resources. (CVE-2011-1521)
    
    Multiple flaws were found in the Python audioop module. Supplying certain 
    inputs could cause the audioop module to crash or, possibly, execute 
    arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-1634, CVE-2010-2089) 
    
    A race condition was found in the way the Python smtpd module handled new
    connections. If a Python SMTP instance were being used as an SMTP proxy, a
    remote user could use this flaw to cause that SMTP instance to terminate.
    (CVE-2010-3493)
    
    An information disclosure flaw was found in the way the Python
    CGIHTTPServer module processed certain HTTP GET requests. A remote attacker
    could use a specially-crafted request to obtain sensitive information about
    the target system. (CVE-2011-1015)
    
    All Python users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
    backported patches to correct these issues.

  description: |-
    The JBoss Seam 2 framework is an application framework for building web
    applications in Java.
    
    It was found that JBoss Seam 2 did not properly block access to JBoss
    Expression Language (EL) constructs in page exception handling, allowing
    arbitrary Java methods to be executed. A remote attacker could use this
    flaw to execute arbitrary code via a specially-crafted URL provided to
    certain applications based on the JBoss Seam 2 framework. Note: A properly
    configured and enabled Java Security Manager would prevent exploitation of
    this flaw. (CVE-2011-1484)
    
    Red Hat would like to thank Martin Kouba from IT SYSTEMS a.s. for reporting
    this issue.
    
    All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3.0.CP09 and 5.1.0 as
    provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to install this

    JBoss Enterprise Web Server (JBEWS) is a fully integrated and certified set
    of components for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the
    industry's leading Web Server (Apache HTTP Server), the popular Apache
    Tomcat Servlet container as well as the mod_jk connector and the Tomcat
    Native library.
    
    This 1.0.2 release of JBoss Enterprise Web Server serves as a replacement
    to JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.1. These updated packages include a
    number of bug fixes. For detailed component, installation, and bug fix
    information, refer to the JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 Release Notes,
    available shortly from the link in the References section of this erratum.

    tomcat6:
    
    A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the Manager application,
    used for managing web applications on Tomcat. If a remote attacker could
    trick a user who is logged into the Manager application into visiting a
    specially-crafted URL, the attacker could perform Manager application
    tasks with the privileges of the logged in user. (CVE-2010-4172)
    
    tomcat5 and tomcat6:
    
    It was found that web applications could modify the location of the Tomcat
    host's work directory. As web applications deployed on Tomcat have read and
    write access to this directory, a malicious web application could use this
    flaw to trick Tomcat into giving it read and write access to an arbitrary
    directory on the file system. (CVE-2010-3718)
    
    A second cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the Manager
    application. A malicious web application could use this flaw to conduct an
    XSS attack, leading to arbitrary web script execution with the privileges
    of victims who are logged into and viewing Manager application web pages.
    (CVE-2011-0013)
    
    A possible minor information leak was found in the way JBoss Web generated
    HTTP BASIC and DIGEST authentication requests. For configurations where a
    realm name was not specified and JBoss Web was accessed via a proxy, the
    default generated realm contained the hostname and port used by the proxy
    to send requests to the JBoss Web server. (CVE-2010-1157)
    
    httpd:
    
    A flaw was found in the way the mod_dav module of the Apache HTTP Server
    handled certain requests. If a remote attacker were to send a carefully
    crafted request to the server, it could cause the httpd child process to
    crash. (CVE-2010-1452)
    
    A flaw was discovered in the way the mod_proxy_http module of the Apache
    HTTP Server handled the timeouts of requests forwarded by a reverse proxy
    to the back-end server. In certain configuration, the proxy could return
    a response intended for another user under certain timeout conditions,
    possibly leading to information disclosure. Note: This issue only affected
    httpd running on Microsoft Windows platform. (CVE-2010-2068)
    
    apr-util:
    
    It was found that certain input could cause the apr-util library to
    allocate more memory than intended in the apr_brigade_split_line()
    function. An attacker able to provide input in small chunks to an
    application using the apr-util library (such as httpd) could possibly use
    this flaw to trigger high memory consumption. (CVE-2010-1623)
    
    Following flaws were corrected in the Solaris and Windows packages. Updates
    for Red Hat Enterprise Linux can be downloaded from the Red Hat Network.
    
    Multiple flaws were corrected in openssl possibly causing crash, code
    execution, or change of session parameters. (CVE-2009-3245, CVE-2010-4180,
    CVE-2008-7270)
    
    Two denial of service flaws were corrected in expat. (CVE-2009-3560,
    CVE-2009-3720)
    
    An X.509 certificate verification flaws was corrected in openldap.
    (CVE-2009-3767)
    
    Additional information about these flaws is available from the CVE link in
    the References section.
    
    All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.1 advised to upgrade to these
    updated packages, which correct these issues.

    xorg-x11-qxl-drv is an X11 video driver for the QEMU QXL video accelerator. This driver makes it possible to use Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 as a guest operating system under KVM and QEMU, using the SPICE protocol.
    
    This updated xorg-x11-drv-qxl package includes fixes for the following bugs:
    
    * When using the xql driver, only a limited number of resolution choices were available for use inside the guest, none of which exceeded 1024x768 in size unless the xorg.conf configuration file was manually edited. This update ensures that larger resolutions are available for guests with appropriate hardware without needing to manually change xorg.conf. (BZ#581841)
    
    * When using the qxl driver, after connecting to a virtual guest over the SPICE protocol and logging into a desktop session from the GDM display manager, attempting to switch to a virtual console using a key combination caused the X server to crash, and GDM to respawn. This update fixes this issue so that, in the aforementioned situation, switching to a virtual console and back to the graphical desktop works as expected. (BZ#585141)
    
    All users of KVM-based virtualization are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which fixes these issues.

    The SBLIM (Standards-Based Linux Instrumentation for Manageability) CIM
    (Common Information Model) Client is a class library for Java applications
    that provides access to CIM servers using the CIM Operations over HTTP
    protocol defined by the DMTF (Distributed Management Task Force) standards.
    
    It was found that the Java HashMap implementation was susceptible to
    predictable hash collisions. SBLIM uses HashMap when parsing XML inputs. A
    specially-crafted CIM-XML message from a WBEM (Web-Based Enterprise
    Management) server could cause a SBLIM client to use an excessive amount of
    CPU. Randomization has been added to help avoid collisions. (CVE-2012-2328)

    The libvirt library is a C API for managing and interacting with the virtualization capabilities of Linux and other operating systems. In addition, libvirt provides tools for remote management of virtualized systems.
    This update fixes the following bugs:
    * Previously, when the default CPU mask was specified while using Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) pinning, virtual CPUs (vCPUs) could not be pinned to physical CPUs that were not contained in the default node mask. With this update, the control groups (cgroups) code correctly attaches only vCPU threads instead of the entire domain group, and using NUMA pinning with the default cpuset subsystem now works as expected. (BZ#1209891)
    * Prior to this update, when starting the libvirt network filter (nwfilter) while no network was available, the nwfilter driver initialization failed. With this update, nwfilter automatically creates a path for the nwfilter.leases file. This allows nwfilter to be independent from the network driver and to be able to start with no network available. (BZ#1208619)
    Users of libvirt are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which fix these bugs. After installing the updated packages, libvirtd will be restarted automatically.

    Red Hat Network Client Tools provide programs and libraries that allow a system to receive software updates from Red Hat Network.
    This update fixes the following bugs:
    * When the rhnpush command was executed with the --server option, and the sslCACert variable was pointing to a non-existent path, rhnpush failed even when the connection to the server used the http protocol instead of https.
    With this update, rhnpush searches for CA certificate only when it is necessary, which prevents the described failure from occurring. (BZ#871028)
    * Previously, the rhn_check command returned an exception when processing a script that contained non-ascii characters. With this update, rhn_check accepts non-ascii characters as expected. (BZ#1003790)
    * When executing the rhnpush command without any options, the command redundantly prompted for user credentials, and afterwards displayed a usage message about missing options. With this update, the command displays available options without asking for credentials. (BZ#1036586)
    * Red Hat Network Client Tools did not calculate the CPU socket information on certain systems properly. With this update, rhn-client-tools parse the /proc/cpuinfo file correctly and thus provide the correct CPU socket information for all systems. (BZ#1094776)
    * Several minor bugs have been fixed in various localizations of the Red Hat Network Client Tools GUI. (BZ#1147319, BZ#1147322, BZ#1147890, BZ#1147904, BZ#1147916)
    * Previously, when running the "firstboot --reconfig" command on the system that was already registered with the Red Hat Subscription Management, the boot procedure failed on the Choose Service page. This bug has been fixed, and the exception no longer occurs on registered systems. (BZ#1147425)
    Users of rhn-client-tools are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which fix these bugs.

    Red Hat Storage is software-only, scale-out storage that provides flexible
    and affordable unstructured data storage for an enterprise. GlusterFS, a
    key building block of Red Hat Storage, is based on a stackable user-space
    design and can deliver exceptional performance for diverse workloads.
    GlusterFS aggregates various storage servers over network interconnections
    into one large, parallel network file system.
    
    This update fixes numerous bugs and adds various enhancements in RDMA, 
    Snapshot, NFS, Quota, and Geo-replication. Space precludes documenting  all of these changes in this advisory. Users are directed to the 
    Red Hat Storage 3 Technical Notes, linked to in the References 
    section, for information on the most significant of these changes.
    
    This advisory adds the following enhancements:
    
    * Red Hat Storage supports Just a Bunch Of Disks (JBOD) on servers with up to 24 disks.Complexity of RAID is avoided by using 3-way replication with JBOD.
    
    * Synchronous three-way replication is now fully supported in Red Hat Storage volumes. 3-way replicated volumes do not require hardware or software RAID. Three-way replication yields best results when used in conjunction with JBODs. Quorum functionality  on three-way replicated volumes helps to prevent split-brain scenarios. 3-way replicated volumes provide additional resiliency in public cloud deployments as well.(BZ#1184075) 
    
    * Multi-threaded epoll is introduced which enables events to be  distributed and improves the performance due the parallel processing of requests/responses received. (BZ#1104459)
    
    *With this fix, the CLI command logs are now dumped into the 'cmd_history.log' file. Now, this file is a non-hidden file.(BZ#1181051)
    
    All users of Red Hat Storage are advised to install these updated packages.

    The kernel-aarch64 packages contain the Linux kernel (vmlinuz), the core of any Linux operating system, for the 64-bit ARM architecture. The kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system: memory allocation, process allocation, device input and output, and so on.
    The kernel-aarch64 packages have been upgraded to the Linus 4.2 kernel with additional patches, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version. (BZ#1222087)
    This update fixes the following bugs:
    * Prior to this update, the X-Gene TRNG driver was not available on APM X-Gene hardware. The underlying source code has been fixed, and the driver now becomes available if the hardware supports it. (BZ#1201902)
    * Due to a parsing error at the perf-probe argument, the perf-probe utility could sometimes fail to add a dynamic tracepoint uprobe event, returning the following error message:
        Failed to write event: Invalid argument
        Error: Failed to add events.
    The underlying source code has been patched, and perf-probe now adds a new event as expected. (BZ#1243663)
    In addition, this update adds the following enhancements:
    * This update provides the kexec and kdump support for the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server for ARM kernel so that  kernel crash dumps can be generated for further analysis. Additionally, the kexec() system call can also be used to boot into another kernel from a running kernel. (BZ#1198804)
    * This update adds AMD Cryptographic Coprocessor support to the kernel-aarch64 package. Several hardware accelerated encryption and hashing
    algorithms are provided. (BZ#1065064)
    * With this update, the kernel maximum logical CPU support has been increased from 64 to 4096 to accommodate the demands of future 64-bit ARM systems. (BZ#1189951)
    * This update provides support for arch-independent ACPI 6.0, implementing the hardware independent parts of the ACPI features, including proper support for GICv3 and the IORT, and the code to parse the tables that describe them. (BZ#1240858)
    * This enhancement update adds support for Cavium ThunderX to the kernel-aarch64 packages, enabling the relevant kconfig options. (BZ#1243000)
    Users of kernel-aarch64 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which fix these bugs and add these enhancements.

    An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.
    Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.
  description: |-
    The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.
    Security Fix(es):
    * A security flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the mark_source_chains() function in "net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_tables.c". It is possible for a user-supplied "ipt_entry" structure to have a large "next_offset" field. This field is not bounds checked prior to writing to a counter value at the supplied offset. (CVE-2016-3134, Important)
    * A flaw was discovered in processing setsockopt for 32 bit processes on 64 bit systems. This flaw will allow attackers to alter arbitrary kernel memory when unloading a kernel module. This action is usually restricted to root-privileged users but can also be leveraged if the kernel is compiled with CONFIG_USER_NS and CONFIG_NET_NS and the user is granted elevated privileges. (CVE-2016-4997, Important)
    * An out-of-bounds heap memory access leading to a Denial of Service, heap disclosure, or further impact was found in setsockopt(). The function call is normally restricted to root, however some processes with cap_sys_admin may also be able to trigger this flaw in privileged container environments. (CVE-2016-4998, Moderate)
    Bug Fix(es):
    * In some cases, running the ipmitool command caused a kernel panic due to a race condition in the ipmi message handler. This update fixes the race condition, and the kernel panic no longer occurs in the described scenario. (BZ#1353947)
    * Previously, running I/O-intensive operations in some cases caused the system to terminate unexpectedly after a null pointer dereference in the kernel. With this update, a set of patches has been applied to the 3w-9xxx and 3w-sas drivers that fix this bug. As a result, the system no longer crashes in the described scenario. (BZ#1362040)
    * Previously, the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) sockets did not inherit the SELinux labels properly. As a consequence, the sockets were labeled with the unlabeled_t SELinux type which caused SCTP connections to fail. The underlying source code has been modified, and SCTP connections now works as expected. (BZ#1354302)
    * Previously, the bnx2x driver waited for transmission completions when recovering from a parity event, which substantially increased the recovery time. With this update, bnx2x does not wait for transmission completion in the described circumstances. As a result, the recovery of bnx2x after a parity event now takes less time. (BZ#1351972)
    Enhancement(s):
    * With this update, the audit subsystem enables filtering of processes by name besides filtering by PID. Users can now audit by executable name (with the "-F exe=<path-to-executable>" option), which allows expression of many new audit rules. This functionality can be used to create events when specific applications perform a syscall. (BZ#1345774)
    * With this update, the Nonvolatile Memory Express (NVMe) and the multi-queue block layer (blk_mq) have been upgraded to the Linux 4.5 upstream version. Previously, a race condition between timeout and freeing request in blk_mq occurred, which could affect the blk_mq_tag_to_rq() function and consequently a kernel oops could occur. The provided patch fixes this race condition by updating the tags with the active request. The patch simplifies blk_mq_tag_to_rq() and ensures that the two requests are not active at the same time. (BZ#1350352)
    * The Hyper-V storage driver (storvsc) has been upgraded from upstream. This update provides moderate performance improvement of I/O operations when using storvscr for certain workloads. (BZ#1360161)

  topic: Updated selinux-policy packages that fix several bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.
  description: |-
    The selinux-policy packages contain the rules that govern how confined processes run on the system.
    This update fixes the following bugs:
    * Due to insufficient SELinux policy rules, sanlock domain was previously not able to access a CEPH file system. As a consequence, sanlock failed to acquire a lock for a CEPH device. The SELinux policy rules have been updated. As a result, the CEPH file system is now correctly labeled as cephfs_t and accessible by the sanlock domain. (BZ#1365640)
    * Previously, AVC denials messages were observed while running Red Hat Gluster Storage (RHGS) Geo-replication. The "dontaudit" rules for the Geo-replication has been added, and the AVC denials messages no longer appear. (BZ#1372182)
    * Previously, with SELinux in enforcing mode, it was not possible to create a UNIX Domain Socket on a Red Hat Gluster Storage (RHGS) volume. As a consequence, the user could not store containers on an RHGS volume. The relevant policy module has been updated, and the user is now able to store containers on a Gluster volume. (BZ#1372191)
    Users of selinux-policy are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which fix these bugs.

    The device-mapper-multipath packages provide tools that use the device-mapper multipath kernel module to manage multipath devices.
    This update fixes the following bug:
    * Previously, Logical Volume Manager (LVM) devices on a multipath mapper were in some cases not properly activated during the boot process, which prevented file systems from being mounted using the /etc/fstab file. With this update, the multipathd service always starts after the systemd-udev-trigger service. This ensures that using /etc/fstab to mount file systems is more reliable. (BZ#1364905)

    The kmod packages provide various programs needed for automatic loading and unloading of modules under 2.6, 3.x, and later kernels, as well as other module management programs.
    This update fixes the following bug:
    * Previously, the weak-modules script was not able to handle a period (.) in names of symbols. Consequently, the device drivers were not migrated after a kernel update, because the script determined them incompatible due to a missing "TOC." symbol. With this update, the weak-modules script handles a period in symbol names. As a result, the device drivers are migrated as expected after a kernel update. (BZ#1367662)

    tomcat5 and tomcat6:

    It was found that web applications could modify the location of the Tomcat
    host's work directory. As web applications deployed on Tomcat have read and
    write access to this directory, a malicious web application could use this
    flaw to trick Tomcat into giving it read and write access to an arbitrary
    directory on the file system. (CVE-2010-3718)

    A second cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the Manager
    application. A malicious web application could use this flaw to conduct an
    XSS attack, leading to arbitrary web script execution with the privileges
    of victims who are logged into and viewing Manager application web pages.
    (CVE-2011-0013)

    A possible minor information leak was found in the way JBoss Web generated
    HTTP BASIC and DIGEST authentication requests. For configurations where a
    realm name was not specified and JBoss Web was accessed via a proxy, the
    default generated realm contained the hostname and port used by the proxy
    to send requests to the JBoss Web server. (CVE-2010-1157)

    httpd:

    A flaw was found in the way the mod_dav module of the Apache HTTP Server
    handled certain requests. If a remote attacker were to send a carefully
    crafted request to the server, it could cause the httpd child process to
    crash. (CVE-2010-1452)

    A flaw was discovered in the way the mod_proxy_http module of the Apache
    HTTP Server handled the timeouts of requests forwarded by a reverse proxy
    to the back-end server. In certain configuration, the proxy could return
    a response intended for another user under certain timeout conditions,
    possibly leading to information disclosure. Note: This issue only affected
    httpd running on Microsoft Windows platform. (CVE-2010-2068)

    apr-util:

    It was found that certain input could cause the apr-util library to
    allocate more memory than intended in the apr_brigade_split_line()
    function. An attacker able to provide input in small chunks to an
    application using the apr-util library (such as httpd) could possibly use
    this flaw to trigger high memory consumption. (CVE-2010-1623)

    Following flaws were corrected in the Solaris and Windows packages. Updates
    for Red Hat Enterprise Linux can be downloaded from the Red Hat Network.

    Multiple flaws were corrected in openssl possibly causing crash, code
    execution, or change of session parameters. (CVE-2009-3245, CVE-2010-4180,
    CVE-2008-7270)

    Two denial of service flaws were corrected in expat. (CVE-2009-3560,
    CVE-2009-3720)

    An X.509 certificate verification flaws was corrected in openldap.
    (CVE-2009-3767)

    Additional information about these flaws is available from the CVE link in
    the References section.

    All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.1 advised to upgrade to these
    updated packages, which correct these issues.

  cve: CVE-2017-1484
  description: |-
    JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform is the next-generation ESB and business
    process automation infrastructure. JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform allows IT
    to leverage existing (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and future
    (EDA and CEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve business
    process execution speed and quality.

    It was found that JBoss Seam 2 did not properly block access to JBoss
    Expression Language (EL) constructs in page exception handling, allowing
    arbitrary Java methods to be executed. A remote attacker could use this
    flaw to execute arbitrary code via a specially-crafted URL provided to
    certain applications based on the JBoss Seam 2 framework. Note: A properly
    configured and enabled Java Security Manager would prevent exploitation of
    this flaw. (CVE-2011-1484)

    Red Hat would like to thank Martin Kouba from IT SYSTEMS a.s. for reporting
    this issue.

    All users of JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 4.3.0.CP04 and 5.1.0 as provided
    from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to install this update.
