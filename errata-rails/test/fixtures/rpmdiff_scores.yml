#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# * Records with id zero in fixtures get loaded with an autoincrement id.
#   Also we get a mysql error about duplicate records when running tests.
#   So going to change this record's id arbitrarily to 10 instead of zero.
# * In app/model/rpmdiff_scores we define PASSED = 0 and set_primary_key to
#   'score', hence this fixture change could potentially cause test failures.
# * We should probably give this some more attention, see Bug 800216.
