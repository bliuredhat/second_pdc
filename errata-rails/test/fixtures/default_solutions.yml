    Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
    relevant to your system have been applied.
    
    To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:
    
    rpm -Fvh [filenames]
    
    where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
    RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
    not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
    can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the
    desired RPMs.
    
    Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
    people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
    launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:
    
    up2date
    
    This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
    RPMs being upgraded on your system.
