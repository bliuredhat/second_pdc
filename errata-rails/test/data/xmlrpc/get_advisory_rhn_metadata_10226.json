A remote\nattacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code via a URL,\ncontaining appended, specially-crafted expression language parameters,\nprovided to certain applications based on the JBoss Seam framework. Note: A\nproperly configured and enabled Java Security Manager would prevent\nexploitation of this flaw.
