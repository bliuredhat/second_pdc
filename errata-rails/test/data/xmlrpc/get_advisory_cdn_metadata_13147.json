  "description": "The SBLIM (Standards-Based Linux Instrumentation for Manageability) CIM\n(Common Information Model) Client is a class library for Java applications\nthat provides access to CIM servers using the CIM Operations over HTTP\nprotocol defined by the DMTF (Distributed Management Task Force) standards.\n\nIt was found that the Java HashMap implementation was susceptible to\npredictable hash collisions. SBLIM uses HashMap when parsing XML inputs. A\nspecially-crafted CIM-XML message from a WBEM (Web-Based Enterprise\nManagement) server could cause a SBLIM client to use an excessive amount of\nCPU. Randomization has been added to help avoid collisions. (CVE-2012-2328)\n\nAll users of sblim-cim-client2 are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain a backported patch to resolve this issue.",
