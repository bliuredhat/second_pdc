                   Red Hat Bug Fix Advisory

Synopsis:          GFS bug fix update
Advisory ID:       RHBA-2005:324-00
Product:           Red Hat Global File System
Advisory URL:      https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2005:324
Issue date:        2005-04-06
Keywords:          package GFS
=====================================================================

1. Summary:

Updated GFS packages that resolve module loading issues and other various
bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 Update 5, kernel
release (2.4.21-31.EL).

2. Description:

The Red Hat Global File System (GFS) provides high availability of critical
server applications in the event of planned or unplanned system downtime.

These updated GFS packages are in sync with the latest kernel
(2.4.21-31.EL). The modules in earlier GFS packages fail to load because
they do not match the running kernel. It is possible to force load the
modules; however, this update alleviates the need to do so.

In addition, the following bugs have been discovered and addressed since
the previous release:

- Fixed a node panic doing a writev
- lock_gulm.o now has the ability to modify its verbosity level
- Pool tools read the /dev/ directory structure when emcpower devices are
detected in /proc/partitions
- Fixed a race condition in the ccsd startup process which causes ccsd to
hang when the 'lo' device has not been configured
- Added sanbox2 fencing agent
- Clarified fence_brocade help
- Init scripts for gnbd have been added
- Added an optional key, "usedev" to a node in the nodes.ccs which will
force gulm to use the IP address from the device specified
- An updated fsck command was added that greatly reduces the fsck times for
GFS filesystems

Users are advised to upgrade to these latest GFS packages, which are
updated for use with the 2.4.21-31.EL kernel.

3. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are
not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you
can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains
the
desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

4. Bugs fixed (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/):

130358 - lock_gulm.o verbosity is not configurable
131142 - unable to select which interface to bind to from lock_gulmd
145121 - ccsd can get stuck on startup with zombie child
146672 - Node panic doing a writev()
150029 - Pool does not see all powerpath devices
150365 - gnbd init.d scripts needed
150366 - lock_gulm needs to start before gnbd_import and gnbd_export
