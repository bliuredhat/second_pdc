Synopsis:          xorg-x11-drv-qxl bug fix update
Advisory ID:       RHBA-2011:11152-00
Product:           Red Hat Enterprise Linux

=====================================================================

1. Summary:

An updated xorg-x11-drv-qxl package that fixes various bugs is now
available.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (v. 5 server) - i386, x86_64
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Desktop (v. 5 client) - i386, x86_64

3. Description:

xorg-x11-qxl-drv is an X11 video driver for the QEMU QXL video accelerator.
This driver makes it possible to use Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 as a guest
operating system under KVM and QEMU, using the SPICE protocol.

This updated xorg-x11-drv-qxl package includes fixes for the following
bugs:

* When using the xql driver, only a limited number of resolution choices
were available for use inside the guest, none of which exceeded 1024x768 in
size unless the xorg.conf configuration file was manually edited. This
update ensures that larger resolutions are available for guests with
appropriate hardware without needing to manually change xorg.conf.
(BZ#581841)

* When using the qxl driver, after connecting to a virtual guest over the
SPICE protocol and logging into a desktop session from the GDM display
manager, attempting to switch to a virtual console using a key combination
caused the X server to crash, and GDM to respawn. This update fixes this
issue so that, in the aforementioned situation, switching to a virtual
console and back to the graphical desktop works as expected. (BZ#585141)

All users of KVM-based virtualization are advised to upgrade to this
updated package, which fixes these issues.
