### Enable multi-product mappings as a default

Previously, 'Support multiple products' feature was inactive by default and
needed to be set manually.

It has been improved and the feature is enabled by default. Additionally, a
message indicating 'Other product versions may be included to the advisory due
to the build' will be shown when a new build is added to an advisory.
