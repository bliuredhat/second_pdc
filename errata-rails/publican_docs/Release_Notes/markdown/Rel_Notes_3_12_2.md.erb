## Process

### Code coverage

The Errata Tool team continues to gradually improve code coverage by requiring
all new features and bugfixes to be accompanied by an autotest.

In Errata Tool 3.12.2 our code coverage a little over 94%.

### CI on Ruby 2.2

Jenkins now runs our full test suite on both
[Ruby 1.8](https://jenkins.engineering.redhat.com/view/Errata%20Tool/job/errata-tool/) and
[Ruby 2.2](https://jenkins.engineering.redhat.com/view/Errata%20Tool/job/errata-tool-ruby2/)
(on RHEL-6 using Software Collections). This is preparation for our upgrade to
Ruby 2.2. The Ruby upgrade should improve Errata Tool's performance, as well as
significantly reduce our technical debt, since Ruby 1.8 is quite old and has
been [unsupported upstream](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/06/30/we-retire-1-8-7/)
for some time.
