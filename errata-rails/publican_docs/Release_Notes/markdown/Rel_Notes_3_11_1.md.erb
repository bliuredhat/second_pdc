Release Notes for Version 3.11.1
================================

Overview
--------

Release 3.11.1 is the second release in Errata Tool 3.11. It closes [9
bugs and RFEs][buglist].

There are bug fixes and enhancements in this release. One of them worth
mentioning is the UI improvement in the Product Listings page. This page
now provides useful debugging information to help figure out problems with
product listings. It shows the calls Errata Tool will make to Brew to fetch
the product listings, display the raw data returned by Brew for each call
and more!

Process and Team Changes
------------------------

### Code coverage metrics

Since the Errata Tool 3.11.0 release, the code coverage ratio (as
reported by Jenkins using rcov) has increased slightly from 92.04% to
92.14%.

[![Rcov coverage report](images/3.11.1/rcov.png)](images/3.11.1/rcov.png)

Increased code coverage means better maintainability, and a reduced chance of
shipping regressions and new bugs. It also means we can more confidently
refactor and improve existing code.

What's Next

### Errata Tool 3.11.z
