### Ensure correct advisory URL is consistently used

An advisory provides a public URL which differs based on where the advisory has
pushed to. There are some advisories visible in RHN and not visible in the
Customer Portal and vice-versa. Previously there were some places where the
correct link would not be consistently chosen.

This has been fixed. All the links to the advisory's detail page will be
generated consistently.
