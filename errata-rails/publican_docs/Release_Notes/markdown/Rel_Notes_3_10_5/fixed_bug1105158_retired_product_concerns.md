### Retired obsolete Product Concerns feature

Errata Tool has previously had a feature allowing users to select the
products they are interested in from their preferences page.  Certain
parts of the UI would then be filtered to only consider products from
this list.

Some time ago, this feature was mostly replaced with customizable
advisory filters now available, and the ability for a user to view or
modify their product concerns was removed.  However, some remnants of
the feature remained.  Users who had previously saved any product
concerns were still provided with a filtered view of products on
certain forms (including the new Y-stream advisory form), repeatedly
causing confusion.

This feature has now been retired for good; all users now see an
unfiltered list of active products in the new Y-stream advisory form
and related forms.
