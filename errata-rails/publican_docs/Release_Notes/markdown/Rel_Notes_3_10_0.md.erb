### Code coverage metrics

Since the Errata Tool 3.9 release our code coverage ratio, as reported by
Jenkins using rcov, has increased by around 2% from 87.7% to 89.1%.

Increased code coverage means better maintainability, and a reduced chance of
shipping regressions and new bugs. It also means we can more confidently
refactor and improve existing code.

### Scrum adoption

Starting with the 3.10 development period, the team has adopted scrum practices
(a bit more seriously than in the past). We are doing two week sprints with
reviews, retrospectives and planning sessions and using JIRA for sprint plans
and for tracking progress.

The goals are to be able to deliver value faster and with more agility, to
access better information to help with planning and scheduling, and to
regularly iterate our processes.

This is an example of a JIRA burndown chart (showing data from the final ET
3.10.0 sprint).

Note that Bugzilla is still the primary location for managing our backlog.
Issues in JIRA are synced in one direction only, hence Bugzilla is the primary
source for reporting and commenting on bugs and RFEs.

### Version numbering changes

We're changing the *version-release* numbering scheme used for Errata Tool
releases. The new scheme introduces an extra level of granularity between minor
release and hotfix. Also it moves the hotfix number out of the release
field and into the version field.

One of the main goals for this change is to make it convenient to do more
frequent, (more "agile"), end-of-sprint deploys. With the new numbering schema
we can more easily schedule further releases in 3.10 before we move on to 3.11.

The new format is *\$MAJOR.\$MINOR.\$INCREMENT.\$HOTFIX&ndash;\$REBUILD*.

For example, the full nvr for this release is `errata-rails-3.10.0.0-0`. There
are more details on the release numbering scheme [available here][relnums].

### Team changes

We've been lucky enough to keep Hao (hyu) on the team (despite previous
announcements about his departure). The development team currently consists of
Hao, Simon (sbaird) and Rohan (rmcgover).

We've also welcomed Mingfang Guo (miguo) who has joined Joyce (jinzhang) on
the QE team, and Jason (jmcdonal)'s role as Product Owner has been solidified
as part of our adoption of scrum.


What's Next
-----------

### Errata Tool 3.10.z

The team will continue to select bugs and RFEs flagged as `errata-3.10` in
Bugzilla for inclusion in two week sprints. Once enough content is verified and
ready to ship we will do an end-of-sprint release. The next release in this
series will be 3.10.1.

To see bugs currently scheduled for ET 3.10 take a look [at the errata-3.10
flag in Bugzilla][bugs3.10].
