### Make it easier to choose the right advisory creation method

The first step when creating an advisory is to choose a creation method.
Certain creation methods are not applicable for certain release types but this
was previously not easy to understand. Often users would choose the wrong
creation method and then be unable to create their advisory without any
explanation why. This frequently lead to confusion, delays and extra support
requests.

In Errata Tool 3.11.0 this is addressed by simplifying and improving the
explanations about the different creation methods, both when the choice is
being made, and on the subsequent advisory creation forms.

Also, since the two different types of manual creation, cloning an advisory
and creating a brand new advisory are essentially identical, they have been
combined into a single option using the same form.
