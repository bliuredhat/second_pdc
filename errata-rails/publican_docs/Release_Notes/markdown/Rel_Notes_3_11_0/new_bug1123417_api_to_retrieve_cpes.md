### Added an API to retrieve CPEs of all products.

An API has been added to Errata Tool to retrieve all CPEs and their
associated variants. This new API allows security users to easily
monitor changes made to any existing variant and spot any variant
with missing CPEs.

This API is documented
[in the Developer Guide](https://errata.devel.redhat.com/developer-guide/api-http-api.html#api-get-apiv1securitycpes).
