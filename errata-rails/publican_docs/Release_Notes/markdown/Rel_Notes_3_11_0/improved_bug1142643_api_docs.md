### Improved and extended API documentation

The documentation for Errata Tool's HTTP API has been revamped.

Previously, the documentation was spread across several resources.  In
particular, documentation for recently added APIs were only available
through a
[generic rdoc generated site](https://errata.devel.redhat.com/rdoc/Api/V1/ErratumController.html),
which made it difficult to locate APIs and to determine which methods
are public API and which methods are implementation details.

The documentation for all HTTP APIs has now been consolidated in
[the Developer Guide](https://errata.devel.redhat.com/developer-guide/pt02.html).
The guide contains a new index of all known APIs.
