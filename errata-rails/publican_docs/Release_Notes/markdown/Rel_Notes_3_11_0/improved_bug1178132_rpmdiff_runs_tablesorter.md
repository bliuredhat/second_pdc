### Table showing RPMDiff runs can now be sorted

Advisories with a huge amount of packages produce a lot of RPMDiff runs.
Navigating through those runs when packages are updated or added becomes
time consuming.

We have now improved the code which adds sorting table columns. This
lets users access the necessary information (e.g. list of contributors)
much easier.
