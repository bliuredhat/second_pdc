### Fixed no results when searching for IN_PUSH advisories

In previous versions of Errata Tool, IN_PUSH advisories were
incorrectly omitted from the results of searches (regardless of whether the
IN_PUSH state was selected).  This has been fixed.

This fix was also applied to production prior to RHEL 7.1 GA.
