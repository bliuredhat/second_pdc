### Extended response to push API

The responses to the
[push APIs](https://errata.devel.redhat.com/developer-guide/api-http-api.html#api-get-apiv1erratumidpush)
have been extended to include the pub options and pre/push tasks associated with a push.
This enables some previously missing use-cases with these APIs.
