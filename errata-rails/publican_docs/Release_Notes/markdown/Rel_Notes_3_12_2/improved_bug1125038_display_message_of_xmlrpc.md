### Display message of XMLRPC exception in bug activity log

Previously if an error occurred while performing an action on a bug, the bug
activity log only showed the name of the exception class.

This has been improved. The bug activity log now shows the message from the
exception to allow the user to diagnose the problem and take action to resolve
the issue.
