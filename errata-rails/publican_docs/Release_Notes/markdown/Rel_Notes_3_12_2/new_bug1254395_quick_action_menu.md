### Menu for quick access to different advisory tabs when viewing advisory lists

Previously, the only advisory page directly accessible when viewing advisory
lists was the advisory summary tab, i.e. the page you are taken to when you
click the advisory.

Hence two separate steps were required in order access a page other than the
summary tab for a particular advisory, the first step being to click on the
advisory to get to the summary tab, and the second step being to click the
appropriate tab or menu item to get to the desired page. Since the summary tab
contains a lot of information it can be slow to load, which makes this
two-step process inconvenient and often time consuming.

This release of Errata Tool introduces a new menu which gives one-step access
to most advisory pages. So for example, if you need to add builds or view TPS
results for a particular advisory you can get to the required page directly
from the advisory list by selecting an item from the new menu.
