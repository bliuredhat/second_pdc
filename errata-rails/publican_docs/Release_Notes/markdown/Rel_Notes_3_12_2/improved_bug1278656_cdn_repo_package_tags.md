### Package tags for Docker CDN repositories

This change introduces support for configuring tag templates for packages
associated with CDN Docker repositories. These templates will be used in
the future for tagging docker images that are pushed through Pub.

This is not required for RPM packages, and the release process for RPMs
is not affected by this change.
