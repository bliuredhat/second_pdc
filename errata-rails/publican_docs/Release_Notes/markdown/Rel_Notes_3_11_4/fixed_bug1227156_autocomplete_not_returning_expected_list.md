### Fix autocomplete not listing channels or repos for some product versions

There were missing related CDN repositories/RHN channels in the autocomplete
search results while trying to attach a CDN Repository/RHN Channel for the two
RHEL 7.1 product versions for the new architectures, 'RHEL-LE-7.1.Z' and
'RHELSA-7.1.Z'.

This issue has been fixed in Errata Tool 3.11.4.
