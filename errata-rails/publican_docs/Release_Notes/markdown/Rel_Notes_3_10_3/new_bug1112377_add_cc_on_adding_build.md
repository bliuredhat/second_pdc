### Automatically add user to CC when adding a build

When a user adds a build to an advisory, that user is now
automatically added to the advisory's CC list.  This applies whether
adding a build via UI or API.

This behavior may be disabled by
[a user preference](https://errata.devel.redhat.com/user/preferences).
