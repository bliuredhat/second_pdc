### Improved links to TPS help

Users with TPS problems often don't realize that they can solve their problem
by following the instructions in the applicable TPS documentation. In Errata
Tool 3.10.1 it's been made a little easier to find TPS help. There is a link
to the TPS help portal added to the TPS page, and the help links for failed
jobs have been updated to link to the most applicable and up-to-date content.
