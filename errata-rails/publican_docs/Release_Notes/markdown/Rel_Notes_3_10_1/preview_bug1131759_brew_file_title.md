### Non-RPM files: support editing title

*Non-RPM files in Errata Tool is a work in progress, currently provided as a Technical Preview.*

When using non-RPM files in an advisory, it will be necessary to set
some additional attributes on the files before the advisory can be
pushed.

This release introduces a new workflow step and UI for editing these
attributes.

It's now possible to use this new UI to set the **title** of non-RPM
files.  This is a brief descriptive piece of text used to identify the
file on the Red Hat Customer Portal.

In future releases of Errata Tool, this UI will be extended to support
more non-RPM file attributes.
