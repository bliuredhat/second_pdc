### Architecture is now displayed for non-RPM files

Certain non-RPM files may have an associated architecture, such as a
virtual machine or docker image built for x86_64 only.

In previous versions of Errata Tool, the architecture of these non-RPM
files was not displayed in the UI.  This has been improved; the architecture
is now displayed alongside the file type on the Builds page for an
advisory.
