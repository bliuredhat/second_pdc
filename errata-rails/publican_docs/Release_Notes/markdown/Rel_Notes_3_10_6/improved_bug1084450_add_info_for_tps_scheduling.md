### Add information panel for TPS scheduling

Due to the complexity of TPS scheduling it is often difficult for users to
find out why TPS jobs are not being scheduled for some RHN channels or CDN
repositories.

To address this, an information panel has been added to the TPS scheduling page
which helps users to understand and troubleshoot TPS scheduling.

For example, in the screenshot below, the new information panel indicates that
a particular RHN Channel is disabled for TPS scheduling, hence Errata Tool
will not schedule a TPS job for it.
