### Link/unlink multiple variants in cdn_repos API

The [CDN repos API](https://errata.devel.redhat.com/developer-guide/api-http-api.html#api-cdn-repositories)
now supports linking and unlinking of multiple variants through the
create and update APIs.

Previously, only one variant could be specified per repository.
