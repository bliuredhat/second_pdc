### Rename "CDN Repos for Docker Metadata"

The "CDN Repos for Docker Metadata" page is used to select CDN repositories
for advisory metadata, for advisories that contain docker images.

The "Docker Metadata" terminology was confusing, as it implied docker-related
metadata such as manifests and tags, instead of advisory metadata. To avoid
confusion, this page, and other related messages, have now been reworded to
refer to "Advisory Metadata" instead.
