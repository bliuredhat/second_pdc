### Updated documentation for requesting access through Maitai

The preferred method for requesting access to Errata Tool, or to
request additional roles for a user account, is now through Maitai,
instead of through RT (Request Tracker).

Errata Tool now directs users to the Errata User Settings process
in Maitai. The [User Guide](https://errata.devel.redhat.com/user-guide/intro-introduction.html#intro-getting-access-to-errata-tool)
has also been updated.
