### Allow inactive batches to be selected in errata filter

Batches that are inactive may now be selected in the errata filter
form. By default, only active batches are shown in the Batch
selector, but clicking the "show inactive" link will enable
the selection of inactive batches (this is similar to how inactive
releases may be selected).
