### Fix errata metadata pushed to CDN does not include references

The advisory references URLs were not included in the CDN metadata pushed
to Pub, resulting in the reference links not appearing in the published
errata in the Customer Portal.

This has been fixed. The reference links will now be included in future
metadata pushes to CDN.
