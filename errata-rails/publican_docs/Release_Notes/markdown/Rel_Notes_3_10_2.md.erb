Process and Team Changes
------------------------

### Code coverage metrics

Since the Errata Tool 3.10.1 release our code coverage ratio, as reported by
Jenkins using rcov, has increased by around 1% from 89.54% to 90.37%.

[![Rcov coverage report](images/3.10.2/rcov.png)](images/3.10.2/rcov.png)

Increased code coverage means better maintainability, and a reduced chance of
shipping regressions and new bugs. It also means we can more confidently
refactor and improve existing code.

### New Team Members

Recently we have welcomed two new developers to the Errata Tool team. This
release is the first with contributions from our new team members, Deshi Xiao
(<dxiao@redhat.com>) and Weitao Zhou (<weizhou@redhat.com>).

What's Next
-----------

### Errata Tool 3.10.z

The team will continue to select bugs and RFEs flagged as `errata-3.10` in
Bugzilla for inclusion in two week sprints. Once enough content is verified and
ready to ship we will do an end-of-sprint release. The next release in this
series will be 3.10.3.
