### Only show multi-product mappings for enabled product versions by default

The multi-product mappings page lists all mappings including for product
versions that are no longer enabled. In this release of Errata Tool the
list will by default only show mappings for enabled product versions, and
hide the mappings that are not likely to be used again.

This makes it easier to identify which mappings are relevant for currently
active advisories.
