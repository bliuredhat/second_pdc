### Make 'Docs Reviewer' visible for assigned Docs request

Previously, if the Docs reviewer was assigned, Errata Tool would show the
Docs reviewer only when the docs are approved or requested.

This has been fixed; currently Docs reviewer will be shown as long as the
Docs were requested before. If no Docs reviewer is assigned, will show
'unassigned'.
