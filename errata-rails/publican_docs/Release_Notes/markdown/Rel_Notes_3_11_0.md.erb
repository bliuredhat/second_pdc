Process and Team Changes
------------------------

### Code coverage metrics

Since the Errata Tool 3.10.6 release, the code coverage ratio (as
reported by Jenkins using rcov) has increased slightly from 91.51% to
92.04%.

[![Rcov coverage report](images/3.11.0/rcov.png)](images/3.11.0/rcov.png)

Increased code coverage means better maintainability, and a reduced chance of
shipping regressions and new bugs. It also means we can more confidently
refactor and improve existing code.

What's Next
-----------

### Errata Tool 3.11.z

The team will continue to select bugs and RFEs flagged as errata-3.11
in Bugzilla for inclusion in two week sprints. Once enough content is
verified and ready to ship we will do an end-of-sprint release. The
next release in this series will be 3.11.1.
