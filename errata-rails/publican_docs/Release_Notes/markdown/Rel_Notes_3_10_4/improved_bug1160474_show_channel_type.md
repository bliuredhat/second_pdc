### Made channel type more visible when viewing RHN channels

In previous versions of Errata Tool it was not easy to see the "type" of an
RHN channel after it was created. (The four different channel types are
'Primary', 'Eus', 'FastTrack' and 'LongLife').

The type was visible when viewing a product version, but when viewing a list
of channels or looking at an individual channel, there was no way to know what
its type was.

This has been fixed; it is now possible to see a channel's type wherever it is
being viewed.
