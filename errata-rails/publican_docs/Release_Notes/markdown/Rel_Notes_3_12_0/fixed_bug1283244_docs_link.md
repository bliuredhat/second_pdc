### Fix link in documentation approval request notification

The email notification sent when documentation approval for an advisory is
requested includes a link to the page where the documentation could be
reviewed and then approved.

The URL for this link was incorrect, resulting in users being redirected to a
list of all the advisories awaiting documentation approval. This has been
fixed and the link now works as expected.
