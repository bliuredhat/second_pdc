### Read-only admin access for all non-readonly Errata Tool users

All Errata Tool users (except those with the `readonly` role) who did
not previously have access to the Administration screen and links,
now have read-only access to these screens. This allows all users to
view product configuration and other details.

All existing users with the `admin` role continue to have read/write
access to the Administration screens.

Users with the `readonly` role are unaffected by this change, and will
not be able to view the Administration screens.
