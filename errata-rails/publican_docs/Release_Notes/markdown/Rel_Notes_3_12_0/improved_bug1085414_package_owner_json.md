### Added package_owner to advisory JSON response

The "package_owner" email address has been added to the people section
of the legacy advisory JSON response.

This also affects the response for the legacy filter API.

The updated JSON responses are documented in the [Errata Tool Developer Guide](https://errata.devel.redhat.com/developer-guide/api-http-api.html#api-legacy).
