Release Notes for Version 3.10.6
================================

Overview
--------

Release 3.10.6 is the seventh release in Errata Tool 3.10. It closes [28 bugs
and RFEs][buglist].

Major new features in this release include an improved user interface for
adding builds to an advisory and a new UI and API for managing users.

The new interface for adding builds displays a progress bar showing the
currently executing Brew query. This should be useful particularly when adding
many builds to an advisory, or when Brew's responses are slow.

Some highlighted bug fixes and RFEs are listed below.

Process and Team Changes
------------------------

### Team changes

It's our pleasure to welcome new team members, Xuebin Dong
(<xudong@redhat.com>), who will spend some time improving and cleaning up our
Javascript and front-end code, and Haibo Lin (<hlin@redhat.com>), who recently
joined the team as an Errata Tool developer. Xuebin and Haibo have previously
worked on projects such as Orgchart, Cantas, TCMS and RT. We'd also like to
farewell developer Deshi Xiao who recently left after four and a half years at
Red Hat, and thank him for his contributions to Errata Tool over the last six
months.

### Code coverage metrics

Since the Errata Tool 3.10.5 release the code coverage ratio, as reported by
Jenkins using rcov, has increased slightly from 90.96% to 91.51%.

[![Rcov coverage report](images/3.10.6/rcov.png)](images/3.10.6/rcov.png)

Increased code coverage means better maintainability, and a reduced chance of
shipping regressions and new bugs. It also means we can more confidently
refactor and improve existing code.

### New Jenkins master

Recently Errata Tool CI was moved over to the new Jenkins instance at
[jenkins.engineering.redhat.com](https://jenkins.engineering.redhat.com/job/errata-tool/).
This should be more reliable than the previous Jenkins master which was running
on OS1 Openstack infrastructure.

### Gerrit upgrade

EngOps have updated code.engineering.redhat.com to a newer version of Gerrit.
This has allowed us to take advantage of some features that were not available
in the previous version such as cherry-picking change sets via the web UI.

What's Next
-----------

### Errata Tool 3.10.7

The final remaining items flagged as `errata-3.10` in Bugzilla are now being
worked on. Once enough content is verified and ready to ship we will do an
end-of-sprint release which will be the last 3.10 release for Errata Tool
before moving to work on items flagged for 3.11.

To see current work in progress take a look at the [scrum board in
JIRA][scrumboard].

To see bugs currently scheduled for ET 3.10 take a look at [bugs flagged with
errata-3.10 in Bugzilla][bugs3.10].

### Errata Tool 3.11

The planning and backlog for Errata Tool is managed in Bugzilla. For details
see [Errata Tool Bug Lists][buglists].

To see what's currently scheduled take a look at [bugs flagged with
errata-3.11][bugs3.11].

As mentioned above, we're aiming to begin work on items flagged as Errata Tool
3.11 once 3.10.7 is released.
