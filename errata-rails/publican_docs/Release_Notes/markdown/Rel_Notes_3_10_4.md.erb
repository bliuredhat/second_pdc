Process and Team Changes
------------------------

### Code coverage metrics

Since the Errata Tool 3.10.3 release our code coverage ratio, as reported by
Jenkins using rcov, has increased slightly from 90.54% to 90.89%.

[![Rcov coverage report](images/3.10.4/rcov.png)](images/3.10.4/rcov.png)

Increased code coverage means better maintainability, and a reduced chance of
shipping regressions and new bugs. It also means we can more confidently
refactor and improve existing code.

### Team Changes

Developer Weitao Zhou has recently left after nearly two and a half years at
Red Hat, and hence won't be contributing any more Errata Tool patches.


What's Next
-----------

### Errata Tool 3.10.z

The team will continue to select bugs and RFEs flagged as `errata-3.10` in
Bugzilla for inclusion in two week sprints. Once enough content is verified and
ready to ship we will do an end-of-sprint release. The next release in this
series will be 3.10.5.
