### Fix incorrect security impact links in CDN metadata

Previously, Errata Tool generated incorrect security impact links which were
shown in the References section of published advisories.

This has been fixed. The links are now only included for advisories that have
a security impact, and now point to the correct severity rating anchor in the
security updates classification page.
