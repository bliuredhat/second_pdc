### No authentication required for api/v1/security/cpes.json API

The authentication restrictions for the api/v1/security/cpes.json API
have been removed at the request of Product Security to enable easier
integration with other systems.

There is no embargoed information available using this API, and this
change does not apply to any other endpoint.
