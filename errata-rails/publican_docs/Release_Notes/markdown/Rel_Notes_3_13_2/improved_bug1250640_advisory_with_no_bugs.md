### Advisories may be created without Bugzilla bugs or JIRA issues

Advisories may now be created without Bugzilla bugs or JIRA issues, by
using the ["Manual Create" form][manual_create]. The "Bugs or JIRA Issues"
field may be left blank when initially creating the advisory.

Bugs or issues must still be added to the advisory before it can move to
QE state, and the normal rules for adding bugs to an advisory still apply.
See the [User Guide][edit_advisory] for more details.

This change allows advisories to be created earlier which enables a more
efficient workflow for some products such as Cloudforms.
