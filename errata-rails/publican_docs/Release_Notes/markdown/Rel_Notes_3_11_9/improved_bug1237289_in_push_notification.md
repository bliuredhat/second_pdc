### Send notification email to Product Security team

Previously there were some users not in the Product Security team with the
ability to push security advisories, and the Product Security team did not
receive any notification about these pushes.

This has been improved. Notification will be sent to secalert@redhat.com
(Red Hat Product Security team), when a user not in the Product Security
team pushes security advisories.
