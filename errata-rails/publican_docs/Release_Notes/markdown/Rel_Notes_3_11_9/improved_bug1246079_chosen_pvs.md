### Searchable product version drop-downs on released packages pages

When viewing or maintaining released package lists in Errata Tool there is a
drop-down select that lets you change between different product versions.

Since the product version list is very long, to make choosing a product
version easier and more convenient, the drop-down select has been made
searchable. This was done by enabling the 'Chosen' jQuery plugin on those
select elements.
