### Improved performance of viewing approved components

The Approved Component List page in Errata Tool was given a significant
performance boost for releases with many packages and bugs in the ACL.

In the case of
[the RHEL-7.0.0 ACL](https://errata.devel.redhat.com/bugs/approved_components/rhel_7_0_0),
the time taken to render the page was reduced by up to 80%.

For more information, see
[Bug 1071138](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1071138).
