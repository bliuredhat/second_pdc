### Send Announcement only visible on security advisories

The *Send Announcement* item on the advisory summary page has been changed.
This summary item will now only show up for security advisories and indicate
if an email has been sent. The Errata Tool functionality to send emails to
security@redhat.com via the web UI has been removed since product security
indicated it was no longer required.
