### HTTP API has been improved to query for comments

The HTTP API now supports querying for comments. The API endpoint supports
paginated results and accepts a filter to query for specific comments. The new
comments API is documented in the
[Errata Tool Developer Guide](/developer-guide/api-http-api.html#api-comments).
