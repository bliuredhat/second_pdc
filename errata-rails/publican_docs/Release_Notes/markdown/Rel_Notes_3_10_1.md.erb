### Code coverage metrics

Since the Errata Tool 3.10.0 release our code coverage ratio, as reported by
Jenkins using rcov, has increased by around 0.5% from 89.1% to 89.54%.

Increased code coverage means better maintainability, and a reduced chance of
shipping regressions and new bugs. It also means we can more confidently
refactor and improve existing code.


What's Next
-----------

### Errata Tool 3.10.z

The team will continue to select bugs and RFEs flagged as `errata-3.10` in
Bugzilla for inclusion in two week sprints. Once enough content is verified and
ready to ship we will do an end-of-sprint release. The next release in this
series will be 3.10.2.

Significant new functionality expected to be available in Errata Tool 3.10.2
includes improvements to the syncing of Bugzilla bugs, (see [bug
1132255](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1132255)), and the
addition of APIs for pushing advisories, (see [bug
1134514](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1134514)).
