## Process and Team Changes

### Code coverage

The Errata Tool team continues to gradually improve code coverage by requiring
all new features and bugfixes to be accompanied by an autotest.

Since the last time we've reported coverage (Errata Tool 3.11.2), total coverage has improved
from 92.27% to 92.65%.

Increased code coverage means better maintainability, and a reduced chance of
shipping regressions and new bugs. It also means we can more confidently
refactor and improve existing code.

### Team changes

During the 3.11.5 development cycle, the team welcomed a new developer, Brian
Kim, as well as former Errata Tool developer Rohan McGovern, both of whom
recently completed an RHN improvement project.

As of 3.11.7, the team has bid farewell to RÃ³man Joost (moving on to Beaker),
and Hao Yu (moving on to Bugzilla).

What's Next

verified and ready to ship we will do an end-of-sprint release. The
next release in this series will be 3.11.8.
