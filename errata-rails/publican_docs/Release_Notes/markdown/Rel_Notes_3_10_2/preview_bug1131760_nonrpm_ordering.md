### Non-RPM files: support setting file order

*Non-RPM files in Errata Tool is a work in progress, currently
 provided as a Technical Preview.*

It is now possible to define a display order for non-RPM files
associated with an advisory.  The order may be managed from the
"Files" tab.

The file order will eventually be used to define the order in which
the files are displayed on Red Hat Customer Portal.
