### Generate comment for initial batch assignment

A new advisory (RHBA or RHEA) may be automatically assigned to a
batch, if its release supports batching.

A comment is now generated to indicate this initial batch
assignment. This makes it clear what batch the advisory has
been assigned to and can help identify problems faster if the
advisory's default batch needs to be modified.
