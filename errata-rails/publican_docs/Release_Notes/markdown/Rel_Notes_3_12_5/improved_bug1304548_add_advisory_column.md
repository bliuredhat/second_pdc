### Advisory links for external tests

A new column with links to advisories has been added for all external
tests, such as CCAT and Covscan.  The test results may be sorted by
the short advisory name by clicking on the column header.

Previously there was no convenient way to see which advisory a particular test
result belonged to when looking at the list of all test results.
