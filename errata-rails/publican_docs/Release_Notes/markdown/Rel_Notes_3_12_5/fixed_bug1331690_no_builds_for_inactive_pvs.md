### Disallow adding builds to inactive product versions

Previously, Errata Tool permitted builds to be added to Product Versions
that were not enabled.

This has been changed. Builds may now only be added for Product Versions
that are enabled. A list of inactive Product Versions is shown on the
Builds page, with an explanation of why builds may not be added to them.
