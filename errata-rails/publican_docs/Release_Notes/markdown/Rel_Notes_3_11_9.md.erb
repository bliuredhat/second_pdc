## Process and Team Changes

### Code coverage

The Errata Tool team continues to gradually improve code coverage by requiring
all new features and bugfixes to be accompanied by an autotest.  Additionally,
an effort was made to identify and remove unused code during the 3.11.9
development cycle.

Since Errata Tool 3.11.8, total coverage has improved from 93.51% to 93.79%.
