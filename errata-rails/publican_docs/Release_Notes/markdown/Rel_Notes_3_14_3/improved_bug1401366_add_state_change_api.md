### HTTP API added to fetch state change history for an advisory

The HTTP API now supports fetching all of the state changes for
an advisory. This provides convenient access to information that
can be used to create statistics and reports about advisory
life-cycles, such as the amount of time spent in each state.

The new state changes API is documented in the
[Errata Tool Developer Guide](/developer-guide/api-http-api.html#api-state-indices).
