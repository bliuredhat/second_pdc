### Now supports generic CAT notification messages

With this release, Errata Tool supports generic CAT notification messages. The
main change is the TARGET key in the message which informs ET about the type of
CAT test. With this generic way of storing CAT results, it is now possible to
support different tests against different pub destinations.
