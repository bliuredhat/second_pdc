### Added API for managing advisory CDN metadata repos

The HTTP API has been extended to support advisory CDN metadata repos.
These are used for advisories containing Docker images.

The API is based on the existing API for managing text-only channels and
repos, and usage is very similar. Documentation can be found in the
[Errata Tool Developer Guide](/developer-guide/api-http-api.html#api-get-apiv1erratumidmetadata_cdn_repos).
