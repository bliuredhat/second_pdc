### Allow grouping advisory lists by release date

Advisory filters allow you to display advisory lists grouped in different
ways, such as by QE owner, by advisory state, by release, etc. This is useful
for reviewing and managing large numbers of advisories.

In this release Errata Tool now also allows displaying advisory lists grouped
by release date. This feature is expected to be used to help manage Z-stream
advisories using the new "consolidated Z-stream process" which aims to
release Z-stream advisories at regular intervals instead of asynchronously.
