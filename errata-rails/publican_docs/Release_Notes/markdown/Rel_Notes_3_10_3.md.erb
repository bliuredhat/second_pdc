Process and Team Changes
------------------------

### Code coverage metrics

Since the Errata Tool 3.10.2 release our code coverage ratio, as reported by
Jenkins using rcov, has increased slightly from 90.37% to 90.54%.

[![Rcov coverage report](images/3.10.3/rcov.png)](images/3.10.3/rcov.png)

Increased code coverage means better maintainability, and a reduced chance of
shipping regressions and new bugs. It also means we can more confidently
refactor and improve existing code.
