Process and Team Changes
------------------------

### Code coverage metrics

Since the Errata Tool 3.11.1 release, the code coverage ratio (as
reported by Jenkins using rcov) has increased slightly from 92.14% to
92.27%.

[![Rcov coverage report](images/3.11.2/rcov.png)](images/3.11.2/rcov.png)

Increased code coverage means better maintainability, and a reduced chance of
shipping regressions and new bugs. It also means we can more confidently
refactor and improve existing code.

### Team Changes

Jason McDonald is stepping down from his role as Product Owner to focus on
Bugzilla and on a newly formed tiger-team looking at improvements to the
overall advisory workflow. The Errata Tool Product Owner role will be taken
over by Simon Baird.

Rohan McGovern is being seconded temporarily to another newly formed
tiger-team which is aiming to address some of the high priority issues with
RHN.

Haibo Lin is leaving the Errata Tool team to join a new team focusing on
DevOps and automation improvements within PnT DevOps.
