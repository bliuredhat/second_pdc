### Fixed "Created At" date format for manually added released packages

The date format of the 'Created At' column in the 'Browse Released Package' page
was different for data added by the 'Add/Update Released Packages' page,
compared to data generated from shipping an advisory.

This has been fixed. All the dates in 'Created At' column are now shown in a
consistent format.
