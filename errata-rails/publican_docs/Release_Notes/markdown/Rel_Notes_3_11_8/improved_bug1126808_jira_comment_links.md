### Create links to JIRA items in comments

JBoss JIRA issue identifiers included in comments will now be shown as links.
The text will be recognized as a JIRA identifier if it is preceded by the word
'JIRA' optionally followed by 'task', 'issue' or 'item' (case-insensitive).

JIRA identifiers take the form of an uppercase project identifier, followed
by a dash then a numerical identifier, for example: ABCDEF-12345.
