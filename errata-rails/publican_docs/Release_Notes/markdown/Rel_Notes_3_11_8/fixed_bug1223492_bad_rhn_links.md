### Fixed RHN links posted to bugs on CDN-only errata

In earlier versions of Errata Tool, shipping a CDN-only advisory could sometimes
incorrectly result in links to RHN being posted on the advisory's bugs.

Specifically, this affected errata where RHN was supported by the product
version(s) on the advisory, but not supported by the variant(s). In these cases,
the advisory summary page would display "Rhn Live is not supported by the
packages in this advisory" and would disallow an RHN Live push, but Bugzilla
comments generated by the advisory would still refer to RHN.

This has been fixed to correctly link to CDN instead in this case.
