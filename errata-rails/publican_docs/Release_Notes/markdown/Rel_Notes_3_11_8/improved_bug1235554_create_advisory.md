### Improved Y-stream / Fast Track advisory creation form

The form for creating a new Y-stream or Fast Track advisory, also known as
"assisted create", has been redesigned.

The updated form provides an improved and streamlined user experience:

* The basic advisory options such as Product and Release have been separated
  from the package list into a dedicated section, which remains on-screen even
  while scrolling through a large package list.

* Ineligible packages are now always hidden by default, and not loaded until the
  UI section is expanded.  This improves the loading speed of the form.

* Some informational messages are now hidden by default, reducing the amount of
  noise in the UI, allowing the user to more easily focus on the task at hand.

* Styles have been refreshed, for a brighter and more easily navigated UI.
