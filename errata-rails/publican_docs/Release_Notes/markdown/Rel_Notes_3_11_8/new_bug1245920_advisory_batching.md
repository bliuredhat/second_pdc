### Added support for Advisory Batching

Errata Tool now supports the grouping of advisories into batches, to facilitate
the release of related or interdependent advisories.

This is an optional feature, and must be enabled for a release. Only users with
the `admin`, `pm`, `releng`, or `secalert` roles may manage batches.

Documentation may be found in the [Errata Tool User Guide](https://errata.devel.redhat.com/user-guide/index.html).

There is also API documentation in the [Errata Tool Developer Guide](https://errata.devel.redhat.com/developer-guide/index.html).
