### Allow copying advisory text without line breaks

When copying and pasting content from one advisory to another it's more
useful if the text does not include hard line breaks. Removing the line breaks
manually after pasting is time consuming and tedious.

In Errata Tool 3.11.8 it's possible to display certain advisory fields with
the text unwrapped, i.e. with hard line breaks removed. This allows convenient
copy and paste without including line breaks in the copied text.
