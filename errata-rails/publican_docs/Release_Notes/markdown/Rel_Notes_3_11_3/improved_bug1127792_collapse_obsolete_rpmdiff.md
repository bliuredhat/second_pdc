### Display obsolete RPMDiff runs initially collapsed

Current and obsolete RPMDiff runs for an advisory are both shown on the same
page in Errata Tool. For advisories with many builds it was hard to
distinguish between current and obsolete runs when the page was scrolled down,
since the relevant heading may have been many screens above the runs currently
visible.

To address this the obsolete RPMDiff runs are now rendered collapsed. They can
be uncollapsed if required by clicking on the applicable heading. Also there
is some text displayed next to the run id that can be used to more easily identify
runs that are obsolete.
