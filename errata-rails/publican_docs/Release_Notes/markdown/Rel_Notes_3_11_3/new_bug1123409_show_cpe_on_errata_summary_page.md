### Show advisory CPE in summary and details page

To assist Product Security team members ensure that security advisories
include the correct CPE information, 'CPE Text' is now shown in the advisory
details section.

In cases where the CPE information for an associated variant is missing, the
field will be highlighted to indicate that some action is required to add the
missing information. Previously this missing information was often only
noticed after the advisory had been shipped live.
