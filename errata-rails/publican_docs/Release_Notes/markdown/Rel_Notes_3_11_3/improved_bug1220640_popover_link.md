### Do not link to '#' for popover items

Popover items that do not link to anything, such as the CPE Text in the Errata details page,
no longer link to '#'. (The href attribute is now omitted from the tag).

The popover still appears when hovering, but the mouse pointer does not change and nothing
happens if the item is clicked.
