### Show the default QE owner when viewing a QE responsibility group

Previously it was not easy to find out via Errata Tool who the default QE owner was for a
given package. Now you can see the default owner on the QE responsibility group page.

This makes it easier to confirm the default owner is correct after syncing the
default owner information from CYP, and in future, from the PDC.
