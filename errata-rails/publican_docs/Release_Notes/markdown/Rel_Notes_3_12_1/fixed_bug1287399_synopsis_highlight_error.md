### Fixed highlighting of invalid Synopsis

Normally, when editing or creating an advisory, any fields which fail validation
are highlighted on the advisory edit form by being underlined in red.

Previously, this did not work for the "Synopsis" field.  This has now been fixed.
This was a cosmetic issue only, and didn't affect the integrity of the field.
