### Show batch release date for advisories in batch

For advisories that are part of a batch, the release date of the batch is
used to determine if the advisory may be released.

Previously, the 'Release Date' shown on the Advisories list and on the advisory
Summary tab did not show the batch release date for advisories that were part
of a batch.

This has been fixed. The 'Release Date' shown will be the release date of the
batch, for advisories that are part of a batch. Also, the release date shown
on the advisory Summary tab now includes a short description indicating where
the date comes from (as shown on the advisories list).
