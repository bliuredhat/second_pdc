### Allow RCM to toggle "Push to Buildroots" feature

Previously, the
["Push to Buildroots"](https://errata.devel.redhat.com/user-guide/additional-features-additional-features.html#additional-features-pushing-builds-to-buildroots)
action was presented for builds on all product versions,
but had no effect for most of them.

Release engineers and Errata Tool administrators may now enable or disable this
feature for each product version.  Disabling the feature will hide the action,
avoiding confusion.
