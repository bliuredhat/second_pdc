Qpid Messaging
==============

Errata Tool publishes messages to the Qpid message broker at `qpid.engineering.redhat.com`.

Documentation about those messages, including routing keys used, message
formats, and example code for consumers in ruby and python, is
[available here](https://docs.engineering.redhat.com/x/WT2nAQ).

<warning>

*It's planned that Qpid will be decommissioned soon, so for new projects you should consider*
*targeting the upcoming [Unified Message Bus (UMB)](umb-umb-messaging.html)*
